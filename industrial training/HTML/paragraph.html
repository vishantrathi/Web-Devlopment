    <p class="p1">
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and layout of your web pages. It provides a way to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website. CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. By using CSS, you can create visually appealing and consistent web pages across different devices and browsers.
